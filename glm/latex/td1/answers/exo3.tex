\begin{exercise}
    Let \(X\) be a \(n \times p\) matrix of rank \(p\). Let \(\hat{Y}\) be the orthogonal projection on the space \([X]\) generated by the column vectors of \(X\) of a vector \(Y\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Show that \(\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i) = 0\) if one of the column vectors of \(X\) is the vector \(\mathbf{1}_n = (1, \ldots, 1)\). Interpret.
\end{exercise}

\begin{answerenum}
    \item Let \(P_X\) be the orthogonal projection matrix on the space \([X]\).
        We have \( \hat{Y} = P_X Y \).
        \[ Y - \hat{Y} = Y - P_X Y = (id - P_X)Y \in [X]^\perp \]
        Since one of the column vectors of \(X\) is \(\mathbf{1}_n\), we have \(\mathbf{1}_n \in [X]\), therefore:
        \[ (Y - \hat{Y})^T \mathbf{1}_n = ((id - P_X)Y)^T \mathbf{1}_n = 0 \]
        which is equivalent to
        \[ \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i) = 0. \]
    \item The residuals \(Y - \hat{Y}\) sum to zero, which means that the average of the fitted values \(\hat{Y}\) is equal to the average of the observed values \(Y\). This is a desirable property in regression analysis, as it ensures that the model does not systematically overestimate or underestimate the response variable.
