# CLAUDE.md

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code when working with Python code in this repository.

## Core Development Philosophy

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose.
- **Fail Fast**: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur.

## üß± Code Structure & Modularity

### File and Function Limits

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code (Except for .tex and .md files)**. If approaching this limit, refactor by splitting into modules.
- **Functions should be under 50 lines** with a single, clear responsibility.
- **Classes should be under 100 lines** and represent a single concept or entity.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Line lenght should be max 100 characters** ruff rule in pyproject.toml
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.



## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

### UV Package Management

This project uses UV for blazing-fast Python package and environment management.

```bash
# Install UV (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Sync dependencies
uv sync

# Add a package ***NEVER UPDATE A DEPENDENCY DIRECTLY IN PYPROJECT.toml***
# ALWAYS USE UV ADD
uv add requests

# Add development dependency
uv add --dev pytest ruff mypy

# Remove a package
uv remove requests

# Run commands in the environment
uv run python script.py
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .

# Install specific Python version
uv python install 3.12
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific tests with verbose output
uv run pytest tests/test_module.py -v

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Check linting
uv run ruff check .

# Fix linting issues automatically
uv run ruff check --fix .

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Run pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üìã Style & Conventions

### Python Style Guide

- **Follow PEP8** with these specific choices:
  - Line length: 100 characters (set by Ruff in pyproject.toml)
  - Use double quotes for strings
  - Use trailing commas in multi-line structures
- **Always use type hints** for function signatures and class attributes
- **Format with `ruff format`** (faster alternative to Black)
- **Use `pydantic` v2** for data validation and settings management

### Docstring Standards

Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules:

```python
def calculate_discount(
    price: Decimal,
    discount_percent: float,
    min_amount: Decimal = Decimal("0.01")
) -> Decimal:
    """
    Calculate the discounted price for a product.

    Args:
        price: Original price of the product
        discount_percent: Discount percentage (0-100)
        min_amount: Minimum allowed final price

    Returns:
        Final price after applying discount

    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent is not between 0 and 100
        ValueError: If final price would be below min_amount

    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(Decimal("100"), 20)
        Decimal('80.00')
    """
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables and functions**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private attributes/methods**: `_leading_underscore`
- **Type aliases**: `PascalCase`
- **Enum values**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Structured Logging

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Log with context
logger.info(
    "payment_processed",
    user_id=user.id,
    amount=amount,
    currency="USD",
    processing_time=processing_time
)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **Always verify file paths and module names** before use
- **Keep CLAUDE.md updated** when adding new patterns or dependencies
- **Test your code** - No feature is complete without tests
- **Document your decisions** - Future developers (including yourself) will thank you

## üîç Search Command Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Always use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of traditional `grep` and `find` commands:

```bash
# ‚ùå Don't use grep
grep -r "pattern" .

# ‚úÖ Use rg instead
rg "pattern"

# ‚ùå Don't use find with name
find . -name "*.py"

# ‚úÖ Use rg with file filtering
rg --files | rg "\.py$"
# or
rg --files -g "*.py"
```

**Enforcement Rules:**

```
(
    r"^grep\b(?!.*\|)",
    "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
),
(
    r"^find\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
    "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
),
```
